## How to Build this project:

**To Build all modules:**

-Dmaven.legacyLocalRepo=true parameter is required. Otherwise, maven fails to resolve some project local repository dependencies, on its very first run.

From project root folder, run

<code>mvn clean install -Dmaven.legacyLocalRepo=true</code>

**To Build dependent projects like service adapters:**

make sure you ran maven build, then from project root folder, run

<code>ant clean init</code>

This arranges dependencies into "dist", "ivy-lib", "lib" and"com.servicemesh.io/lib" folders as required for service adapter projects.
