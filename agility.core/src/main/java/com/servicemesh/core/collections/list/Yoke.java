/**
 * The Yoke class implements a doubly linked list. The various algorithms used to manipulate the Yokes in the linked list have
 * some interesting properties that make this implementation more useful than more naive doubly linked list implementations. The
 * algorithms for this implementation originally come from an article from Niklaus Wirth (XXX - can't find the reference). This
 * class is very powerful but is likely to blow your mind. It is recommend to work out a few examples by hand to reach an
 * enjoyable epiphany or two.
 * <p>
 * Some of the features include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Reversible insert operations (e.g. a.insertLeft(b); a.insertLeft(b); done together is a no-op).
 * <li>Commutative insert and append operations (i.e. a.insertLeft(b) and b.insertLeft(a) produce identical results).
 * <li>The ability to splice together multiple doubly linked lists at any point.
 * <li>The ability to divide a doubly linked list in two from any two points in the list.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The following examples should illustrate how insertLeft and insertRight work.
 * <p>
 * If you have the list segment
 * <p>
 * <code>...->a->b->c->... (only showing right pointers)</code>
 * <p>
 * and you invoke b.insertLeft(x = new Yoke()) you get...
 * <p>
 * <code>...->a-><b>x</b>->b->c->...</code>
 * <p>
 * However, if you invoke b.insertRight(x = new Yoke()) you get...
 * <p>
 * <code>...->a->b-><b>x</b>->c->...</code><br>
 * <p>
 * If you have 2 lists (showing circular lists here by repeating the end elements)...
 * <p>
 * <code>a->b->c->d->e->a</code><br>
 * <b>p->q->r->s->t->p</b>
 * <p>
 * and you do either a.insertLeft(p) or p.insertLeft(a), you get
 * <p>
 * <code><b>p->q->r->s->t</b>->a->b->c->d->e<b>->p</b>
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * Invoking a.insertLeft(p) again, or invoking p.insertLeft(a) splits the long list back into the original 2 lists again.
 * <p>
 * Calling a.insertRight(p) or p.insertRight(a) gives you
 * <p>
 * <code>a-><b>q->r->s->t->p</b>->b->c->d->e->a</code>
 * <p>
 * Invoking a.insertRight(p) again, or p.insertRight(a) splits the long lists back into the original 2 lists. <em>Very Cool!</em>
 * <p>
 * Another way to think of it is that when operating on the two separate lists with a and p, a.insertLeft(p) splices the entire
 * list attached to p to the left of a. What's more, this splicing is done in such a way that p is the element from its original
 * list that is furthest to the left away from a.
 * <p>
 * When there is just one big list, calling a.insertLeft(p), splits the list in two by separating a from its left neighbor and
 * separating p from its left neighbor to form two smaller circular lists. Magic.
 * <p>
 * Exercise: What happens if you call a.insertLeft(p) followed by a.insertRight(p)? Is it useful?
 * <p>
 * I tried unsuccessfully for hours to get this to work properly using Generics. I came very close but alas no cigar. For now you
 * need to cast when you subclass from this.
