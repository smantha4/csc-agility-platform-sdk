/**
 * The ByteBladder class is a convenience wrapper for the java.nio.ByteBuffer class. ByteBuffer has a number of deficiencies that
 * make it difficult to use. These include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A ByteBuffer is fixed size. If you need more space, you need a new ByteBuffer. This is inconvenient as it may be difficult
 * to know how large the buffer needs to be ahead of time without performing multiple passes over data. It is also inconvenient
 * because the size of a buffer needed to hold the incoming bytes that form a logical message may be unknown ahead of time. With
 * ByteBuffer programmers need to pay a lot of attention to buffer size management and overflow issues.
 * <li>ByteBuffer presents a strange bimodal interface where the buffer is either set up for input or output at any given time.
 * There is no simple test to determine what mode the ByteBuffer is in (was flip() called last, or compact()...? Multiple pointers
 * within the buffer must be tested). There are no convenient ways to repeatedly switch back and forth between input and output
 * modes to do efficient event driven asynchronous I/O. This is error prone and common source of errors with ByteBuffers.
 * <li>ByteBuffer has a limited number of methods for reading and writing different types of values (e.g. arrays).
 * </ul>
 * The benefits of ByteBladder include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>ByteBladder's dynamically manages the size of the underlying buffer so that programmers's don't have to keep track
 * themselves.
 * <li>ByteBladder maintains separate input and output pointers to make it trivial to determine where data should be read from and
 * written to.
 * <li>ByteBladder provides absolute and relateive get and put operations for primtive values and arrays.
 * <li>ByteBladder allows for seperate input and output marks to make it easier to scrutinize changes to the buffers due to read
 * and write operations.
 * <li>ByteBladder provides a number of methods to get access to the underlying ByteBuffer set up in the correct manner for
 * reading and writing.
 * </ul>
 * This is the structure of a ByteBladder. Empty cells are allocated but have no valid data. Cells marked with 'X' contain valid
 * data. <br>
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *    +-+-+-   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-   -+-+-+
 *    | | | ... | |X|X|X|X|X|X...X|X|X|X|X|X| | ... | | |
 *    +-+-+-   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-   -+-+-+
 *     ^           ^                         ^           ^
 *     |           |                         |           |
 *     0          out                        in       capacity

 * XXX - It may be useful to have this implement java.io.DataInput and java.io.DataOutput.
